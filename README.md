# NarrowGlint-s-ULX-Commands
These commands can be used on any server but were designed for jailbreak. Just meant for learning lua and having fun.

Commands:  
!killrich | Kills all players above 99HP.  
!slowdown | Kills all players sprinting.  
!doors | Toggles whether the cell doors are open or not. -- Meant for Jailbreak -- Shouldnt mess up the server at all though.
